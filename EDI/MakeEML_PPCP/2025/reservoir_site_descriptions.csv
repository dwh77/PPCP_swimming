Reservoir,Site,Site_description,Latitude,Longitude
CCR,1,Pelagic upstream site near floating platform at CCR boat launch (used for Ironman sampling near where the swimmers enter the water),37.3839,-79.9491
CCR,2,Pelagic upstream site to the west of the central depth transect of reservoir adjacent to the floating platform at CCR (used for Ironman sampling where swimmers turn the reservoir upstream after entering water),37.385,-79.951
CCR,3,Pelagic upstream site in central depth transct of CCR upstream of boat launch approximately halfway to Angel Branch cove (used for Ironman sampling; upstream most point swimmers are in the water),37.3922,-79.9488
CCR,4,Littoral site immediately adjacent to boat launch at CCR (used for Ironman sampling where swimmers left the water),37.3845,-79.9471
CCR,5,Pelagic upstream site in central depth transect that is approximately halfway between boat launch at CCR and dam (used for Ironman sampling to estimate downstream transfer of PPCPs to dam),37.3788,-79.9529
CCR,50,Pelagic deep hole site of Carvins Cove Reservoir near dam (also site 6 for Ironman sampling); the closest access point to the dam via boat and 21 m at full pond,37.3706,-79.9582
