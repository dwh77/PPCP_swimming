The presence and concentration of acetaminophen, caffeine, and triclosan were monitored from 2021 - 2023 in Carvins Cove Reservoir before and after large swimming events. Carvins Cove Reservoir (Roanoke, Virginia) is owned by the Western Virginia Water Authority as a primary drinking water source for Roanoke, Virginia. In June 2021, 2022, and 2023, there were one-day large swimming events hosted in the reservoir. We collected samples every year several days prior to swimming, immediately after swimming, and several days after swimming. In 2022 and 2023, we additionally collected samples three to four weeks after swimming. On each sampling day, we collected water samples for the three compounds at 0.5 m depth at six sites in the reservoir. Samples underwent solid phase extraction and were analyzed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Data on detection and concentration of each compound are reported.
